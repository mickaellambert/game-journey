# Game Journey

## Repository Status

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§

This repository is currently a work in progress. We are actively developing the project and adding new features. Stay tuned for updates!

## Project Overview

**Game Journey** is a web application that allows users to create and manage their personal video game collections. The backend is built with PHP and Symfony, while the frontend is developed using React. The application integrates with the IGDB API to automatically populate the database with game information as users add games to their collections. Key features include:

- **User Management**: Users can register and manage their accounts.
- **Game Collection**: Users can add and track games in their personal collections.
- **IGDB Integration**: Automatic retrieval of game details from the IGDB API.
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the status of each game (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

The project follows modern development practices, including adherence to PSR standards, SOLID principles, and comprehensive API documentation.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the Symfony-based API.
- `frontend/`: Contains the React-based frontend.

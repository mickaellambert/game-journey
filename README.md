# Game Journey

## Repository Status

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§

This repository is currently a work in progress. I am actively developing the project and adding new features. Stay tuned for updates!

## Project Overview

This project is an API built with PHP and Symfony that allows users to create and manage their personal video game collections. The API integrates with the IGDB API to populate our database with game information as users add games to their libraries. Key features include:

- **User Management**: Users can register and manage their accounts.
- **Game Collection**: Users can add games to their personal collections.
- **IGDB Integration**: Automatically fetch game details from the IGDB API.
- **Status Tracking**: Track the status of each game (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

The project adheres to the latest coding standards and best practices, including PSR, SOLID principles, and comprehensive API documentation.
